## Code Assist
***Google Assistant meets VS Code***

Made during Prototype hackathon at IIITA.

Code Assist is an extension to help you with most common actions in VS Code directly from Google Assistant.
Currently, functionality is limited with actions like, Git commands, open commands and some editor actions like Formatting working.

I plan to develop this further at a later point of time.
